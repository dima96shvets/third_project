Project Overview:

This is a simple web application designed to provide users with basic information about various games, along with the ability to leave comments on each game’s page.

Main Functionality:

Homepage:

The homepage displays clickable images of the games. Each image leads to a dedicated game page where users can view detailed information about the game.
Game Page:

On the game page, users can find information such as the game’s name, developer, publisher, release date, and a description.
Users (as "guests") can also leave a comment on the game by entering their name and comment in the provided fields. These comments are saved and displayed under the respective game page.
Admin Functionality:

The site includes an admin panel that is accessible only to users with the correct credentials.
The admin panel allows the admin to:
Add new games to the database.
Update existing game information.
Delete games from the database.
Delete user comments from game pages.
This functionality helps to manage the content on the site and keep game information up to date.
